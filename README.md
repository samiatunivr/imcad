This project is designed and developed to help computer vision & machine learning community to generate a good training image set from the web in automatic way. Normally, generating a training image set in a traditional way like by hand or crawl the web is costly in a sense that when human is used as an intermediary (ask human to label images as good or bad) is bounded to human expertise in the domain and sometimes maybe it is hard to find  such useful resources. On the other hand, crawling the web for images using a single keyword is simply unpleasant since it turns large portion of strange images(far from what we desire and expect). Thus, it is potentially beneficial to design and develop a method, capable of overcoming both scenarios( human efforts & training image deviation within a class itself or within the entire set).

So we started to develop the application (though the computation time is relatively high compared to the standard search engines) but looking at the result is worth waiting. 

To see a live demo of the application, please dont foreget to hestitate to try it yourself (www.klimble.com/sami/IMCAD)
